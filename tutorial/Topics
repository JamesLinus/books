[Draft]

List of topics to conver in the book.  I currently envision the book
in two sections: section 1 should be a tutorial sacrificing depth in
order to give a more general feeling for the language; section 2 will
cover each key topic separately and in some depth.

I have put stars beside topics and sub-topics that I believe should be
addressed only in section 2.
